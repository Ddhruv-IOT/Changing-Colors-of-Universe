## Story behind this app
While learning to use different colorspaces on images in OpenCV, I double-clicked on the tab key to see all available options in the jupyter notebook. Then from those options, I randomly choose one of the options and it gave a very fancy look, so I tried the same with other options also, and then finally thought to make an app out of this.
